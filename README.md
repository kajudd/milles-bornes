# Mille Bornes

Created as my Hackbright final project. Wrote a web app of the card game [Mille Bornes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mille_bornes).

The object is to travel 1,000 miles by playing miles cards while opponents can put hazard cards (such as flat tires, accidents, etc.) in your way, and you must recover from these with either repair or immunity cards.

The miles are represented on a Google map as the player races their opponent toward Paris.
